# 3. To-Do List App (Text-Based)
# Build a to-do list manager that:
# Allows users to add tasks with priorities (e.g., "Buy milk - high").
# Lets them view the current list, delete tasks by number, and mark tasks as complete.
# Keeps looping until the user types “exit”.
# Shows a summary at the end: number of completed tasks vs pending.
# Skills practiced: lists, string parsing, loops, input, CRUD basics

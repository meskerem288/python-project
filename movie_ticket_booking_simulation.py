#  4.Movie Ticket Booking Simulation
# Simulate a movie theater booking system that:
# Shows a list of available movie titles, showtimes, and seat prices.
# Asks the user to choose a movie and number of tickets.
# Confirms total price and asks if they want to book another movie.
# Ends when they say “no” and displays total bookings and cost.
# Skills practiced: loops, input, conditionals, calculations, nested dictionaries
